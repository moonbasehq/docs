# Team subscriptions

By default, every team (even personal accounts are teams under the hood) are created with `free` subscriptions.

Free tiers give you enough data ingest to properly get a feel for the platform. By default, free tiers are given `1gb` of free ingest for the month.

If you surpass this limit on a free tier, we will have to block api calls until you upgrade your subscription.

You can upgrade your subscription under the `billing` tab at the top right of the console.

## Included ingest

Each tier gets an amount of 'included' storage (i.e. you only pay /gb once you pass this ingest amount).

```
Free: 1gb
Basic: 3gb
Pro: 3gb
```

## Ingest calculations

Ingest is calculated based on how long your team has been in a subscription.

You can only change subscriptions once every 24 hours.

At the end of every month, we calculate how much data was ingested for the previous month based on start/finish of the subscription.

### 30 day example:

Total amount ingested for the month: 50gb

```
Free tier: days 1-9 -- (free)
Basic tier: days 10-22 -- 27gb ingested, (27 * $0.39) = $10.53
Pro tier: days 23-30 -- 13gb ingested, (13 * $0.44) = $5.72

------

Total billed for month: $16.25
```
